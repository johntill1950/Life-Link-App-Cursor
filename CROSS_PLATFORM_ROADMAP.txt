CROSS-PLATFORM APP ROADMAP & BEST PRACTICES
===========================================

GOALS:
------
- Native iOS & Android app (with push notifications)
- Web-based user interface (e.g., for Emergency Service Providers)
- Two-way notifications between all platforms (using native push, not email)
- Easy reviewer access during development (shareable, interactive preview links)
- Low cost, easy development, and future scalability

RECOMMENDED STACK & PATHWAY:
----------------------------
A. Use a Cross-Platform Framework
   - React Native (for iOS & Android)
     - Shares much of your current React/Next.js codebase.
     - Integrates well with Firebase for auth, database, and notifications.
   - Next.js (Web)
     - Continue using for your web dashboard and admin/reviewer interface.

B. Use Firebase for Backend
   - Authentication: Handles users across web and mobile.
   - Firestore/Realtime Database: Stores and syncs data in real time.
   - Cloud Messaging (FCM): Free, instant push notifications to iOS, Android, and web.
   - Hosting: For your web app, with free SSL and custom domains.

C. Use Vercel for Web Previews
   - Free for personal/small team use.
   - Deploys every branch/PR to a unique URL (great for reviewers).
   - Integrates with GitHub for CI/CD.

HOW THIS MEETS YOUR NEEDS:
--------------------------
| Need                | Solution                        | Cost                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Native iOS/Android  | React Native + Firebase         | Free to start, $99/yr Apple, $25 one-time Google |
| Web dashboard       | Next.js + Firebase + Vercel     | Free for small projects     |
| Two-way notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging      | Free                        |
| Reviewer access     | Vercel preview URLs             | Free                        |
| Scalability         | Firebase scales automatically   | Pay as you grow             |

DEVELOPMENT & REVIEWER WORKFLOW:
-------------------------------
- Develop locally using Cursor/VSCode.
- Push to GitHub.
- Vercel auto-deploys every branch/PR to a unique preview URL (e.g., https://your-branch-name.vercel.app).
- Share preview links with reviewers for interactive testing.
- For mobile:
    - Use Expo (with React Native) for easy device testing and sharing (Expo Go app, QR codes).
    - When ready, build native binaries for App Store/Play Store.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS: HOW IT WORKS
--------------------------------
- Web: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for browser push notifications.
- Mobile: FCM integrates with both iOS and Android for native push.
- Two-way: Any user (web or mobile) can trigger notifications to others via Firebase functions or direct FCM calls.

POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES & COSTS:
-------------------------------
Difficulties:
- React Native learning curve if you haven't used it before (but similar to React).
- Push notification setup for iOS requires Apple Developer account and certificates.
- App Store/Play Store review process for public release.
- Some platform-specific code may be needed for advanced features.

Costs:
- Firebase: Free tier is generous; costs scale with usage.
- Vercel: Free for personal/small team, paid for advanced features.
- Apple Developer: $99/year (required for iOS push and App Store).
- Google Play: $25 one-time.

BEST PRACTICE PATHWAY:
----------------------
1. Continue developing your web app with Next.js, Firebase, and Vercel.
2. Set up Vercel preview deployments for easy reviewer access.
3. Start a React Native project (with Expo) for mobile apps.
4. Share code and logic between web and mobile where possible.
5. Integrate Firebase Auth, Firestore, and FCM in both web and mobile.
6. Test push notifications on all platforms.
7. Invite reviewers to Vercel preview URLs (web) and Expo Go links (mobile).
8. When ready, build and submit native apps to the App Store and Play Store.
