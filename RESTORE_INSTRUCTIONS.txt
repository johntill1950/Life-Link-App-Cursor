-------------
The backup script (backup_life_link_app.sh) performs the following actions:
1. Creates a timestamped backup folder
2. Stages and commits all current changes
3. Pushes the current branch to GitHub
4. Merges changes into the main branch
5. Pushes the main branch to GitHub
6. Creates a complete backup of the project
7. Creates a zip archive of the backup
8. Includes a backup_info.txt file with restoration instructions
